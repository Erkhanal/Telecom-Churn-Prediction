## Introduction:
<div align="justify">The telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge with customer churn, where customers frequently switch between service providers. With an annual churn rate averaging between 15-25%, telecom companies encounter substantial financial implications due to the high cost of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones. Retaining profitable customers has emerged as a top priority for incumbent operators. To address this issue, predictive analytics plays a crucial role in identifying customers at high risk of churn. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm and develop models capable of predicting churn based on usage features.</div>

## Objectives: 
<div align="justify">This project aims to use data from a big telecom company to predict which customers might churn. By understanding why customers churn, the goal is to help the company keep them. We will build a machine learning model that looks at how customers use their phones and predicts if they might churn soon. The main objective is to make the best prediction machine learning model using the provided data that is able to predict churning customers.</div>


## Analysis Approach:  
<div align="justify">To tackle this problem effectively, I have established a structured data analysis approach.<br>

- Data Preprocessing:<br> It includes understanding, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, dropping unnecessary columns, and standardizing data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset. This will involve univariate, and bivariate analysis.

- Feature Importance:<br>Identifying key variables that strongly influence target variables using statistical methods such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- Feature Engineering:<br> It Explore opportunities for creating new features that might enhance model performance and transform variables to better suit the regression models.

- Visualizations:<br>It includes creating visual representations of the data to facilitate a better understanding of the insights, trends, and relationships.

- Model Building:<br>It includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, performing scaling, partition the data into features (X) and the target variable (Y) and performing analysis on the dataset.

- Model Evaluation:<br>It includes evaluating, validating, comparing the performance of models and examining the accuracy values. And analyzing which model provides better insights into telecom churn.</div>
